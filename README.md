# Sales Pulse – End-to-End Business Intelligence & Revenue Analysis

## Project Overview

Sales Pulse is a comprehensive end-to-end business intelligence project that analyzes multi-branch spare parts and service sales data at invoice and line-item level. Using **SQL for data modeling and analysis** and **Python for visualization**, this project transforms raw ERP-style transactional data into actionable, decision-ready insights.

The analysis focuses on revenue performance, operational efficiency, customer demand patterns, and business risk—mirroring how real-world analytical work is delivered to decision-makers.

## Business Questions Answered

* How is the business performing overall, and where is revenue coming from?
* Which branches drive volume vs. value?
* How dependent is revenue on spare parts, services, or a few high-value invoices?
* Are transactions volume-driven or value-driven?
* Where do revenue concentration risks and growth opportunities exist?

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **SQL (MySQL)** – data cleaning, feature engineering, KPI design, and analysis
* **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** – exploratory and presentation-ready visualizations
* **GitHub** – version control and project documentation

## Analytical Workflow

### Step 1: Data Understanding & Schema Alignment

* Audited multiple branch-level tables
* Identified schema inconsistencies
* Unified data into a single analytical view while preserving branch-specific attributes

### Step 2: Data Profiling & Quality Audit

* Validated transaction counts and date coverage
* Identified missing, malformed, and structurally incomplete fields
* Confirmed invoice-level granularity

### Step 3: Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

* Removed non-transactional rows
* Standardized dates and numeric fields
* Engineered **Item Category (Service vs Spare Part)**
* Correctly labeled missing branch entries as **Counter Sales**

### Step 4: Business Performance & Revenue Analysis

* Overall revenue and transaction scale
* Monthly revenue trends and seasonality
* Branch-level revenue contribution
* Revenue mix by services vs spare parts

### Step 5: Profitability & Operational Efficiency

* Average revenue per invoice and per line item
* Branch billing efficiency comparison
* Category-level value density
* Identification of premium invoices

### Step 6: Customer & Demand Intelligence

* Revenue concentration analysis
* High-impact (VIP-style) invoice identification
* Bulk vs. one-time transaction behavior
* Risk and opportunity interpretation

### Step 7: KPI Framework Design

* Revenue health metrics
* Customer and demand KPIs
* Operational efficiency indicators
* Risk monitoring metrics

### Step 8: Decision & Action Blueprint

* Revenue risk mitigation strategies
* Upselling and bundling opportunities
* Branch optimization roadmap
* Data process improvement actions

### Step 9: Executive Conclusion

* Consolidated insights into a decision-ready business narrative
* Demonstrated analytical maturity beyond descriptive reporting

## Key Insights

* The business operates on a **high-volume, mid-value billing model**
* **Spare parts drive ~75% of revenue**, acting as the financial engine
* **Services support engagement and retention** but are under-monetized
* A small percentage of invoices contribute disproportionately to revenue
* Revenue dependence on a primary branch introduces operational risk

---

## Value Delivered

* Converts raw transactional data into executive-level intelligence
* Identifies growth levers without increasing transaction volume
* Highlights revenue concentration risks early
* Provides a scalable KPI framework for long-term monitoring

---

## Why This Project Stands Out

This project goes beyond basic SQL queries by:

* Preserving real-world data imperfections
* Designing KPIs and decision frameworks
* Translating analysis into clear business actions
* Demonstrating how analysts think, not just query
